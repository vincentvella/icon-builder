# Expo App Icon Builder

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## What's in this app?

This app is a simple app that lets you create an app icon for your Expo project using emojis or uploaded images.

[NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev) for styling.

[Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) for routing.

[EmojiMart](https://github.com/missive/emoji-mart) for emoji picker.

I ported most of the app icon image generation code from [Evan Bacon's Original Icon Builder](https://github.com/EvanBacon/icon-builder).

> The Original Icon Builder from Evan was unfortunately subject to the [MaxCDN shutdown](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/issues/580)
